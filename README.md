# EX3 Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the profit of a city using the linear regression model with gradient descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.You are given 4 input data points with 3 features each and a target value (y) for each point.

2.Set theta = [0, 0, 0, 0] (4 coefficients for 3 features + intercept).
Run gradient descent:

3.Calculate predictions, compute errors, and update theta iteratively.


4.After finding optimal theta, predict the value for any new data point.


## Program:
